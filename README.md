Exploratory Data Analysis of Uber trip data focusing on data cleaning and visualization.

# Uber Drive Data Analysis (2020)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was an exploratory deep-dive into Uber trip data. The goal was to understand driver patterns, identify the most common trip purposes, and analyze distance distributions.

## 🛠️ Data Science Skills Applied
* **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** Used Pandas and NumPy to process the dataset.
* **Data Cleaning:** Managed missing values in the 'PURPOSE' column and handled data types.
* **Visualizations:** Created plots using Seaborn and Matplotlib to show the concentration of business vs. personal trips.
* **Feature Analysis:** Identified 176 unique starting locations and calculated trip proportions.

## 💡 2026 Perspective
Looking back at this assignment, there is one key visual improvement I would make:
* **Visualization Readability:** I would adjust the bar plot's x-axis labels (using rotation or figure resizing) so they are all clearly visible instead of being condensed, ensuring the insights are easier to read at a glance.
